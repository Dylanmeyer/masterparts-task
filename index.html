                        <p>I am a driven and hardworking individual that enjoys getting things done. 
                           I do not shy away from challenges and I always strive to do my best in every situation I come up against.
                           I enjoy learning new things and pushing the limits of what i know, constantly trying to improve, constantly trying to better myself.
                           No matter my circumstances or the situation I find myself in I always aim to give 100% of myself towards what I am doing.
                           When it comes to coding I still have a long way to go, but I will continue to improve and get better.
                           I love the fact that you can take an idea and make something from it just by a few lines of code...the only limit being your imagination
                           and understanding of what you want.The challenging moments are the best because thats when you actually learn something.

                        <p>I believe that a good work ethic sets you up for success and is beneficial in every work environment.
                            It is a set of values centered on importance of work and manifested by determination or desire to work hard.
                            I am a very meticulous with the things I do, everything has a place, time and it needs to be perfect.
                            It is really great for organizing and keeping track of things, it also allows you to have a better work flow
                            because everything is where it needs to be, everything is recorded and backed up.
                            With a good work ethic and proper structure anything is possible and can be great for working in teams.

                    <div class="flip-card-back">
                        <p>I am really not that experienced in the coding field and I still have so much to learn, but its something I enjoy
                            so im easily motivated to do my work. I have alot to offer and experience in many other areas of work.
                            I can quickly learn something new and find different methods of how I can implement it in a specific situation.
                            I am a team player and i work well with others. If given a role of leadership I am not scared to step up to the plate
                            helping everyone in the team work together and get the job done.
                            Thinking outside the box and being creative is something I like to do and makes great practice.
                            To be honest I do not have alot of patience for alot of things and it is probably my biggest weakness,
                            but I have found ways to work around that. Another weakness might be I get bored quick if something gets 
                            tedious, I cant do the same things over and over again.

                        <p>My goals and plans for the future firstly is to get better in the coding field, doing some online courses and improve
                            on the things I struggle with...especially in javascript. Another goal is to keep working in the coding field to
                            build more experience within the field and hopefully land a great job some day.
                            Another goal for me would be to get a proper setup for coding at home which will definetly help me code at home.
                            For now my plan is to do my best with the opportunity before me, to complete everything to the best of my ability
                            so that it can benefit me in the long run and the future.
